    <p>Carrot cake is delicious, but sometimes a loaf is better. So here's a carrot loaf recipe, because sometimes, well, a loaf is 
        better then a cake. At least we think that! ...Huh? You like cake better? Ok that's fine. ...No I mean I get why you could like
        cake better, but a loaf just seems better to me so... ...Well how about you just try this recipe? ...I not trying to force you,
        but you're on a carrot loaf recipe page so obviously you're interested, so just give it a try, then like, next week, make a
        cake or something if you want a cake so bad jeez. ...Ok so then make a cake next month if that's too soon for you. I don't 
        know what to tell you just try the damn recipe or not! ðŸ™„</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h3>The Loaf</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups carrots, grated, well packed</li>
        <li>1 cup walnuts, or pecans, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. cinnamon</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 oz. cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tsp. vanilla</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups icing/confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Line a 4 1/2 x 10-inch or 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside. *I like to just line the 
            bottom and long sides with one sheet of parchment, overhanging the sides by an inch or so, to use as handles 
            to lift it out of the pan later.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large bowl with an electric beater or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream
             together the white sugar and oil. Add the shredded carrots and mix in. Add the eggs and beat in. Add the 
             nuts and stir to combine. Stir in the flour mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared baking pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 40-50 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the centre comes out clean. 
            *A lot of factors can affect baking time. Every oven is different and the type of baking pan you use can 
            also affect the baking time. You loaf might take longer. As such, you must test the loaf with a long skewer 
            or tester (so it reaches into the very centre of the loaf) before taking it out of the oven. It should come 
            out clean. If in doubt, leave it in the oven a bit longer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cool the loaf in the pan for 15 minutes, then lift out to a cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To make frosting: Beat together the cream cheese, butter and vanilla. Add the icing sugar and beat until fluffy 
            and smooth.</li>
    </ol>
