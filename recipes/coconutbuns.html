    <br>
    <p>Coconut buns, also known as cocktail buns or gai mei bao, are a Hong Kong bakery staple. These buns consist of fluffy 
        milk bread with a glossy, golden brown, egg washed top, and buttery sweet coconut filling. They are a classic Chinese bakery
        item and a must-try!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>The Dough</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cake flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons caster sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cake flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry milk powder</li>
        <li>½ cup desiccated coconut</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the bread dough, and be sure your ingredients are at room temperature. 
            In the bowl of a mixer, add the heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour, 
             bread flour, yeast, and salt (in that order). 
             Using the dough hook attachment, turn on the mixer at its lowest setting.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. 
            (Note: if you’re in a humid climate, and the dough is too sticky, add more flour ¼ cup 
            at a time until the dough comes together). After 15 minutes, the dough is ready for proofing. 
            Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 
            about 1.5X its original size.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the filling by thoroughly combining all the filling ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>After the bread dough has proofed for an hour, put the dough back in the mixer and knead slowly for another 
            5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into 12 equal pieces.</li>
        <br>
            <li>Flatten each piece of dough with your hands into a rough oval shape, about 4 inches long and 3 inches wide. 
            Spread about a tablespoon of filling onto the middle of the dough, and roll it into a cigar, tucking the ends 
            under the bun to completely seal the filling in. We like this method because it evenly distributes the filling 
            throughout the bun.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer the buns to a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise for another 
            45 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. For the topping, mix together 1/3 cup cake flour, 3 tablespoons softened butter, 
            and 4 ½ teaspoons caster sugar, and transfer to a piping bag or small zip top bag with a small corner cut off. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once the buns have risen, brush with egg wash. Pipe two stripes of your topping mixture onto each bun, and sprinkle each 
            with sesame seeds. Bake for 15-17 minutes until golden. Remove from the oven and brush with the sugar syrup.</li>
    </ol>
